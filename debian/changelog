mapserver (4.8.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Paul Wise ]
  * Make the build target no longer depend on build-indep. This is not
    policy-compliant (see 7.6 and 4.8), but it is needed to work around
    the fact that the autobuilders call debian/rules build (instead of
    build-arch), but do not install Build-Depends-Indep packages.
    build-indep is an indirect dependency of the binary and binary-indep
    targets, so non-autobuilder builds will still work.

  * Reindend all copyright files to make them easier to read.  Use

      Schuyler Erle and myself as uploaders.
    - Do not build libmapserver-dev any more.  It can't be used without
      the defines used during compilation, the ABI is not stable, and
      there are no client programs using it at the moment.

      in mapprojhack.c ANSI C.  The patch is already in upstream CVS.

      complete the work even if config.* is missing.
    - Drop php support, as the php version in Debian is built without
      the required regex support.  Document the changes in
      60_php_drop.dpatch.
